We went back-and-forth with modifier classes, but the fact remained, we just want to turn _the thing_ **on** and **off**. No matter what it is! That's where the idea of `active` originated.

The general idea is that on any of our components that have varying states, `active` is used to indicate _the thing_ being **on**. This makes it easy to programmatically control a component's state if you're building a more complex application and utilizing something like a JavaScript framework.

The `active` class is utilized to toggle various components like [accordion](/docs/components/accordion/), [info box](/docs/components/info-box/), [modal](/docs/components/modal/), and [drawer](/docs/components/drawer/).
