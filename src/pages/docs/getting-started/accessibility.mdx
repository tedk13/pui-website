Here at [Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://ritterim.com), we build websites and apps that are accessible and scalable. We follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" rel="external" target="_blank">WCAG 2.1</a> guidelines for all of our projects, with a close eye on the future of accessibility. 

We leverage WAI-ARIA roles, labeling, and descriptions, along with keyboard functionality and contrast where possible. Many of these decisions fall on the person or team implementing Platform UI into their project. 

We made a point to include the now familiar <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/" rel="external">screen reader only</a> class, `sr-only`, for content that can be confusing to a screen reader. Elements or actions that would benefit from additional text can use this class to offer context to a screen reader.

There are also instances where content that is present for design or aesthetic purposes should be hidden from a screen reader to eliminate confusion. This is where ARIA labeling comes to the rescue.

In the snippet below we have a button with an icon only - concise and generally understood by a sighted user.

<div class="highlight">
```html
<button class=”button”>
   <i class=”pi-download”>
</button>
```
</div>

<br />
You can use <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/" rel="external" target="_blank">WAI-ARIA</a> roles and attributes along with the `sr-only` class to improve the experience for users who require assistive technology.

<div class="highlight">
```html
<button class=”button”>
   <i class=”pi-download” aria-hidden=”true”>
   <span class=”sr-only”>Download a copy of your form</span>
</button>
```
</div>
